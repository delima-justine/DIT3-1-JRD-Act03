1. What design choices did you make (colors, font, layout)?
   - I decided to just use the foundation or the built-in colors in the Android Studio to keep it simple.
   
2. How did you ensure the screen is user friendly and accessible?
   - I ensured that my screen is user friend and accessible by placing the elements(images, text) where it is readable and not in random order.
   - I also used constraintLayout and constraints to position the elements.
   
3. What would you improve if this were a real app?
   - What I would improve if this were a real app were the colors and font, I want to choose another color palette and fonts but I can not do it yet because I did not explore it in Android Studio.
   - I want to make it with navigation/sidebar but simple and accessible for all users.
